Those gathered around the Goblet of Fire stood back to let them pass, watching eagerly. Madame Maxime entered the hall behind her students and organized them into a line. One by one, the Beauxbatons students stepped across the Age Line and dropped their slips of parchment into the blue-white flames.  As each name entered the fire, it turned briefly red and emitted sparks. \\"What d\'you reckon\'ll happen to the ones who aren\'t chosen?\\"  Ron muttered to Harry as the veela-girl dropped her parchment into the Goblet of Fire.  \\"Reckon they\'ll go back to school, or hang around to watch the tournament?\\" \\"Dunno,\\" said Harry.  \\"Hang around, I suppose... . Madame Maxime\'s staying to judge, isn\'t she?\\"  When all the Beauxbatons students had submitted their names, Madame Maxime led them back out of the hall and out onto the grounds again. \\"Where are they sleeping, then?\\"  said Ron, moving toward the front doors and staring after them. A loud rattling noise behind them announced Hermione\'s reappearance with the box of S. P. E.W. badges. \\"Oh good, hurry up,\\" said Ron, and he jumped down the stone steps, keeping his eyes on the back of the veela-girl, who was now halfway across the lawn with Madame Maxime. As they neared Hagrid\'s cabin on the edge of the Forbidden Forest, the mystery of the Beauxbatons\' sleeping quarters was solved.  The gigantic powder-blue carriage in which they had arrived had been parked two hundred yards from Hagrid\'s front door, and the students were climbing back inside it.  The elephantine flying horses that had pulled the carriage were now grazing in a makeshift paddock alongside it. Harry knocked on Hagrid\'s door, and Fang\'s booming barks answered instantly. \\"Bout time!\\"  said Hagrid, when he\'d flung open the door.  \\"Thought you lot\'d forgotten where I live!\\" \\"We\'ve been really busy, Hag -\\" Hermione started to say, but then she stopped dead, looking up at Hagrid, apparently lost for words. Hagrid was wearing his best (and very horrible) hairy brown suit, plus a checked yellow-and-orange tie.  This wasn\'t the worst of it, though; he had evidently tried to tame his hair, using large quantities of what appeared to be axle grease.  It was now slicked down into two bunches - perhaps he had tried a ponytail like Bill\'s, but found he had too much hair. The look didn\'t really suit Hagrid at all. For a moment, Hermione goggled at him, then, obviously deciding not to comment, she said, \\"Erm - where are the skrewts.\\" \\"Out by the pumpkin patch,\\" said Hagrid happily.  \\"They\'re get-tin\' massive, mus\' be nearly three foot long now.  On\'y trouble is, they\'ve started killin\' each other.\\" \\"Oh no, really?\\"  said Hermione, shooting a repressive look at Ron, who, staring at Hagrid\'s odd hairstyle, had just opened his mouth to say something about it. \\"Yeah,\\" said Hagrid sadly. \\"S\' okay, though, I\'ve got \'em in separate boxes now.  Still got abou\' twenty.\\" \\"Well, that\'s lucky,\\" said Ron. Hagrid missed the sarcasm.  Hagrid\'s cabin comprised a single room, in one corner of which was a gigantic bed covered in a patchwork quilt.  A similarly enormous wooden table and chairs stood in front of the fire beneath the quantity of cured hams and dead birds hanging from the ceiling.  They sat down at the table while Hagrid started to make tea, and were soon immersed in yet more discussion of the Triwizard Tournament.  Hagrid seemed quite as excited about it as they were. \\"You wait,\\" he said, grinning.  \\"You jus\' wait.  Yer going ter see some stuff yeh\'ve never seen before.  Firs\' task. . . ah, but I\'m not supposed ter say.\\" \\"Go on, Hagrid!\\" Harry, Ron, and Hermione urged him, but he just shook his head, grinning. \\"I don\' want ter spoil it fer yeh,\\" said Hagrid.  \\"But it\'s gonna be spectacular, I\'ll tell yeh that.  Them champions\'re going ter have their work cut out. Never thought I\'d live ter see the Triwizard Tournament played again!\\" They ended up having lunch with Hagrid, though they didn\'t eat much - Hagrid had made what he said was a beef casserole, but after Hermione unearthed a large talon in hers, she, Harry, and Ron rather lost their appetites.  However, they enjoyed themselves trying to make Hagrid tell them what the tasks in the tournament were going to be, speculating which of the entrants were likely to be selected as champions, and wondering whether Fred and George were beardless yet. A light rain had started to fall by midafternoon; it was very cozy sitting by the fire, listening to the gentle patter of the drops on the window, watching Hagrid darning his socks and arguing with Hermione about house-elves - for he flatly refused to join S."\n}', '{\n  "id": "bca1eda18b31f3c7410657a35b4dbf6908a8f0f9",\n  "text": " See you do the same for Alayaya.  No sooner was Joff off than a runner came panting up the steps.  My lord, hurry!  He threw himself to one knee.  They’ve landed men on the tourney grounds, hundreds! They’re bringing a ram up to the King’s Gate.   Tyrion cursed and made for the steps with a rolling waddle. Podrick Payne waited below with their horses. They galloped off down River Row, Pod and Ser Mandon Moore coming hard behind him. The shuttered houses were steeped in green shadow, but there was no traffic to get in their way; Tyrion had commanded that the street be kept clear, so the defenders could move quickly from one gate to the next. Even so, by the time they reached the King’s Gate, he could hear a booming crash of wood on wood that told him the battering ram had been brought into play. The groaning of the great hinges sounded like the moans of a dying giant. The gatehouse square was littered with the wounded, but he saw lines of horses as well, not all of them hurt, and sellswords and gold cloaks enough to form a strong column.  Form up,  he shouted as he leapt to the ground. The gate moved under the impact of another blow.  Who commands here? You’re going out.    No.  A shadow detached itself from the shadow of the wall, to become a tall man in dark grey armor. Sandor Clegane wrenched off his helm with both hands and let it fall to the ground. The steel was scorched and dented, the left ear of the snarling hound sheared off. A gash above one eye had sent a wash of blood down across the Hound’s old burn scars, masking half his face.   Yes.  Tyrion faced him.  Clegane’s breath came ragged.  Bugger that. And you.   A sellsword stepped up beside him.  We been out. Three times. Half our men are killed or hurt. Wildfire bursting all around us, horses screaming like men and men like horses—    Did you think we hired you to fight in a tourney? Shall I bring you a nice iced milk and a bowl of raspberries? No? Then get on your fucking horse. You too, dog.   The blood on Clegane’s face glistened red, but his eyes showed white. He drew his longsword.  He is afraid, Tyrion realized, shocked. The Hound is frightened. He tried to explain their need.  They’ve taken a ram to the gate, you can hear them, we need to disperse them—    Open the gates. When they rush inside, surround them and kill them.  The Hound thrust the point of his longsword into the ground and leaned upon the pommel, swaying.  I’ve lost half my men. Horse as well. I’m not taking more into that fire.   Ser Mandon Moore moved to Tyrion’s side, immaculate in his enameled white plate.  The King’s Hand commands you.    Bugger the King’s Hand.  Where the Hound’s face was not sticky with blood, it was pale as milk.  Someone bring me a drink.  A gold cloak officer handed him a cup. Clegane took a swallow, spit it out, flung the cup away.  Water? Fuck your water. Bring me wine.   He is dead on his feet. Tyrion could see it now. The wound, the fire… he’s done, I need to find someone else, but who? Ser Mandon? He looked at the men and knew it would not do. Clegane’s fear had shaken them. Without a leader, they would refuse as well, and Ser Mandon… a dangerous man, Jaime said, yes, but not a man other men would follow.  In the distance Tyrion heard another great crash. Above the walls, the darkening sky was awash with sheets of green and orange light. How long could the gate hold?  This is madness, he thought, but sooner madness than defeat. Defeat is death and shame.  Very well, I’ll lead the sortie.   If he thought that would shame the Hound back to valor, he was wrong. Clegane only laughed.  You?   Tyrion could see the disbelief on their faces.  Me. Ser Mandon, you’ll bear the king’s banner. Pod, my helm.  The boy ran to obey. The Hound leaned on that notched and blood-streaked sword and looked at him with those wide white eyes. Ser Mandon helped Tyrion mount up again.  Form up!  he shouted.  His big red stallion wore crinet and chamfron. Crimson silk draped his hindquarters, over a coat of mail. The high saddle was gilded. Podrik Payne handed up helm and shield, heavy oak emblazoned with a golden hand on red, surrounded by small golden lions. He walked his horse in a circle, looking at the little force of men. Only a handful had responded to his command, no more than twenty. They sat their horses with eyes as white as the Hound’s. He looked contemptuously at the others, the knights and sellswords who had ridden with Clegane.  They say I’m half a man,  he said.  What does that make the lot of you?   That shamed them well enough. A knight mounted, helmetless, and rode to join the others. A pair of sellswords followed. Then more. The King’s Gate shuddered again. In a few moments the size of Tyrion’s command had doubled. He had them trapped. If I fight, they must do the same, or they are less than dwarfs.   You won’t hear me shout out Joffrey’s name,  he told them.  You won’t hear me yell for Casterly Rock either. This is your city Stannis means to sack, and that’s your gate he’s bringing down."\n}', '{\n  "id": "bcb38ead4d4094c37f8a5b60e1c5f2306233d306",\n  "text": " So say I, Peregrin son of Paladin of the Shire of the Halflings.\'       And this do I hear, Denethor son of Ecthelion, Lord  of Gondor, Steward  of the High King, and I will not forget it, nor fail to reward that which is  given: fealty with love, valour with honour, oath - breaking with vengeance.\'  Then Pippin received back his sword and put it in its sheath.       \'And now,\' said  Denethor, \'my first command  to you: speak and be  not  silent! Tell me your full tale, and see that you recall all that  you can of  Boromir, my son. Sit now and begin!\' As he  spoke  he  struck a small silver   gong  that  stood  near his footstool,  and at  once  servants came forward.  Pippin saw then that they had been standing in alcoves on either side of the  door, unseen as he and Gandalf entered.       \'Bring wine and food and seats for the guests,\' said Denethor, \'and see  that none trouble us for one hour.\'       \'It is all that  I have to spare,  for there is  much else to heed,\' he  said  to Gandalf.  \'Much of more import,  it  may seem,  and yet to  me less   ####-pressing. But maybe we can speak again at the end of the day.\'       \'And earlier, it is to  be hoped,\' said Gandalf. \'For I have not ridden  hither from Isengard, one hundred and fifty leagues, with the speed of wind,   only to bring you one small warrior, however courteous.  Is it naught to you   that Thjoden has fought a great battle and  that Isengard is overthrown, and  that I have broken the staff of Saruman?\'       \'It is much to me. But I know already  sufficient of these deeds for my  own  counsel  against  the menace of the East.\' He turned his  dark  eyes on  Gandalf, and now  Pippin  saw a likeness between  the  two, and he  felt the  strain between them,  almost as if  he saw a line of smouldering fire, drawn  from eye to eye, that might suddenly burst into flame.       Denethor  looked indeed much more like a great wizard than Gandalf did,  more kingly,  beautiful, and powerful; and older. Yet  by a sense other than  sight  Pippin perceived that  Gandalf had  the greater power and the  deeper  wisdom, and a majesty that  was veiled.  And he was  older, far older.  \'How  much older?\' he wondered, and  then  he thought  how odd it was that he  had  never thought about it before. Treebeard had  said  something about wizards,  but even  then  he  had  not  thought of Gandalf as  one  of them. What  was  Gandalf? In what  far  time and place did he come  into  the world, and when  would he leave it? And  then his musings broke off, and he saw that Denethor   and Gandalf  still looked each other in the eye, as if  reading the  other\'s  mind. But it was Denethor who first withdrew his gaze.       \'Yea,\' he  said; \'for though  the Stones  be lost, they say,  still the  lords of Gondor have keener sight than lesser men, and many messages come  to  them. But sit now!\'       Then men came bearing a chair and a low stool, and one brought a salver   with  a  silver flagon  and cups,  and  white cakes. Pippin sat down, but he  could  not  take his eyes  from  the  old lord.  Was it so, or  had  he only  imagined it, that  as he spoke of the Stones a sudden gleam  of his  eye had  glanced upon Pippin\'s face?        \'Now tell  me your tale,  my  liege,\' said Denethor, half  kindly; half  mockingly. \'For the words  of one whom my son so befriended will be   welcome  indeed.\'       Pippin never forgot that hour in the great  hall under the piercing eye  of the Lord of  Gondor,  stabbed ever and anon by his  shrewd questions, and   ####-all the while conscious of  Gandalf at his side, watching and listening, and  (so Pippin felt) holding  in check a rising  wrath and impatience.  When the  hour was  over and Denethor again rang  the gong, Pippin felt worn out.  \'It  cannot  be  more  than  nine o\'clock,\'  he thought.  \'I  could now eat three  breakfasts on end.\'       \'Lead  the  Lord  Mithrandir  to  the housing prepared for  him,\'  said  Denethor, \'and his companion may lodge with him for the present, if he will.   But  be it known that  I have  now sworn him to  my service, and he shall be  known as Peregrin son of Paladin and taught the lesser pass-words. Send word  to the Captains that they shall wait on me here, as soon as may be after the  third hour has rung.       \'And  you,  my Lord  Mithrandir, shall come too, as and when  you will.  None shall hinder your coming to me at any time, save only in my brief hours  of sleep. Let your wrath at an old man\'s folly run off and then return to my  comfort!\'       \'Folly?\'  said  Gandalf. \'Nay,  my lord, when you are a dotard you will  die. You can  use  even your grief as  a cloak.  Do you  think that I do not  understand your purpose in  questioning for an hour one who knows the least,  while I sit by?\'       \'If you understand  it,  then  be  content,\' returned  Denethor. \'Pride  would  be  folly that disdained help and counsel  at need; but you deal  out  such gifts according to your own designs. Yet  the Lord of Gondor  is not to   be made the tool  of other men\'s purposes, however worthy."\n}', '{\n  "id": "bca942d41595407d3240130fe4a08f3b07f26413",\n  "text": " It was cruel.  It was like being  stabbed with knives. I struggled.  But  he sa id: \\"Wait  a   moment!  We shall meet again soon. Tell Saruman  that this dainty is not for   him. I will send for it at once. Do you understand? Say just that!\\"       \'Then  he gloated over me. I felt  I was  falling  to pieces. No, no! I  can\'t say any more. I  don\'t remember anything else.\'       \'Look at me!\' said Gandalf.       Pippin looked up straight into his eyes. The wizard held his gaze for a   moment  in silence. Then  his face grew  gentler, and the shadow  of a smile  appeared. He laid his hand softly on Pippin\'s head.       \'All right!\' he said. \'Say no more! You have taken no harm. There is no  lie in your eyes, as I feared. But  he did not speak long with you.  A fool,  but an honest  fool,  you remain, Peregrin Took. Wiser ones might  have done  worse  in such  a  pass. But mark this!  You  have  been saved, and all your  friends too, mainly by good fortune, as it is called. You cannot count on it  a second  time. If he had  questioned  you, then and there, almost certainly  you would have told all that you know, to the ruin of us all. But he was too  eager. He did not want information only: he wanted you,  quickly, so that he  could deal with you in the  Dark Tower, slowly.  Don\'t shudder! If  you will  meddle  in  the affairs  of Wizards, you  must  be prepared  to think of such  things. But come! I forgive you. Be comforted! Things have not turned out as  evilly as they might.\'       He  lifted  Pippin  gently  and  carried  him  back to  his bed.  Merry  followed, and sat down beside him. Lie there and rest, if you can,  Pippin!\'  said Gandalf. \'Trust me. If you feel an itch in your palms again, tell me of   ####-it!  Such things can be cured. But anyway, my dear hobbit, don\'t put  a lump   of  rock  under  my  elbow  again! Now, I will leave you  two together for a   while.\'       With  that Gandalf  returned to the others, who  were still standing by  the  Orthanc-stone in troubled thought. \'Peril comes in the night when least  expected,\' he said. \'We have had a narrow escape!\'       \'How is the hobbit, Pippin?\' asked Aragorn.       \'I think all  will  be well  now,\' answered  Gandalf. \'He was  not held  long, and  hobbits have  an  amazing power of  recovery. The memory, or  the  horror of it, will probably fade  quickly. Too  quickly, perhaps. Will  you,  Aragorn, take the Orthanc-stone and guard it? It is a dangerous charge.\'       \'Dangerous indeed, but not to all,\' said Aragorn. \'There is one who may  claim it by right.  For this assuredly  is the palantnr of Orthanc  from the  treasury  of  Elendil, set here by  the Kings  of Gondor. Now my hour  draws  near. I will take it.\'       Gandalf looked  at Aragorn, and then, to the surprise of the others, he  lifted the covered Stone, and bowed as he presented it.       \'Receive it,  lord!\' he said: \'in earnest of other things that shall be  given back. But if I may counsel you in the use  of your own, do not use  it  -- yet! Be wary!\'       \'When have I been hasty or unwary, who have  waited and prepared for so  many long years?\' said Aragorn.       \'Never  yet.  Do not then  stumble at the end  of the  road,\'  answered  Gandalf. \'But  at the least keep this thing secret. You, and all others that  stand  here! The hobbit, Peregrin,  above  all should not know  where it  is  bestowed.  The evil fit may come on him again. For alas! he  has  handled it   and  looked in it, as should never have  happened. He ought  never  to  have   touched it in Isengard,  and  there I should have been quicker. But my  mind  was bent  on Saruman, and I did not at once  guess the  nature of the Stone.  Then I was weary, and as I lay pondering it, sleep overcame me. Now I know!\'       \'Yes, there can  be no doubt,\' said Aragorn. \'At last we know the link\'  between Isengard and Mordor, and how it worked. Much is explained.\' \'Strange  powers have our enemies, and strange  weaknesses!\' said Thjoden. \'But it has  long been said: oft evil will shall evil mar. \'       \'That many times is seen,\' said Gandalf. \'But at this time we have been  strangely fortunate. Maybe, I  have been  saved by this  hobbit from a grave  blunder. I  had considered whether or not to probe this Stone myself to find   ####-its uses. Had I done so, I should have been revealed to him myself. I am not   ready for such a  trial, if indeed I  shall ever be so:  But even if I found  the power to withdraw myself, it would be disastrous for  him to see me, yet   -- until the hour comes when secrecy will avail no longer.\'       \'That hour is now come, I think,\' said Aragorn.       \'Not yet,\' said Gandalf. \'There remains a short while of doubt which we  must use. The Enemy, it is clear, thought that  the Stone was in  Orthanc  --  why should he not? And that therefore the hobbit  was captive there,  driven  to look in the  glass for his  torment by  Saruman.  That dark mind will  be  filled  now with  the voice  and face of the hobbit and with expectation: it  may take some time before he  learns his error."\n}', '{\n  "id": "bcef7423e81b5b74a990e627cecd39ac69330012",\n  "text": "  Saruman  is  still in his tower. There was a noise in the  night like a wind  coming  up the valley. I think the Ents  and Huorns that had been away  came  back  then; but where they have all gone to  now, I  don\'t  know. It  was  a   misty,  moisty morning  when we  climbed down  and  looked  round again,  and  nobody was about. And that is  about all there  is  to tell. It seems almost  peaceful  now after all  the turmoil. And safer too, somehow,  since Gandalf  came back. I could sleep!\'       They  all fell silent  for a while. Gimli re-filled his pipe. \'There is  one thing I wonder about,\' he  said as he lit it with his  flint and tinder:  \'Wormtongue. You told Thjoden he was with Saruman. How did he get there?\'       \'Oh yes,  I forgot about him,\'  said Pippin. \'He did not get here  till  this morning. We had just lit the fire and had some breakfast when Treebeard  appeared again.

All\'s well; aye very well  indeed!\\" he laughed, and slapped his  thighs. \\"No more Orcs  in Isengard, no  more axes! And there will be folk  coming up from the South before the day is  old; some that you may be glad to see.\\"       \'He had hardly said that, when we heard the sound of hoofs on the road.  We rushed out  before the gates, and  I stood and stared,  half expecting to  see Strider  and Gandalf come riding up at the head of  an army. But  out of  the  mist there  rode a man on  an old tired  horse; and he  looked  a queer    ####-twisted sort of creature  himself. There was no one  else. When he came. out  of the  mist and suddenly saw  all the ruin and wreckage in front of him, he  sat and gaped, and his face went almost green. He was so bewildered that  he  did not seem to notice us at first. When he did, he gave a cry, and tried to  turn his horse round and ride off. But Treebeard took three strides,  put out  a long  arm, and  lifted him out  of the saddle. His horse bolted in terror,  and he grovelled  on the ground. He said he was Grnma, friend and counsellor   of  the  king,  and had  been sent  with important messages  from Thjoden to  Saruman.       \'\\"No one else would dare to ride through the open land, so full of foul  Orcs,\\" he said,  \\"so I was sent. And I have had a perilous journey, and I am  hungry and weary. I fled far north out of my way, pursued by wolves.\\"       \'I caught the sidelong looks he gave to Treebeard, and I said to myself  \\"liar\\".  Treebeard looked at him in  his long slow  way for several minutes,  till the wretched man was squirming on the floor. Then at last he said: \\"Ha,  hm, I was expecting  you, Master Wormtongue.\\" The man  started a t that name.  \\"Gandalf got  here first. So I know as much about you  as I need, and I know  what to do with you. Put all the rats in one trap, said Gandalf; and I will.  I am the master of Isengard now, but Saruman is locked in his tower; and you  can go there and give him all the messages that you can think of.\\"       \'\\"Let me go, let me go!\\" said Wormtongue. \\"I know the way.\\"       \'\\"You knew the way, I  don\'t doubt,\\"  said Treebeard. \\"But  things have  changed here a little. Go and see!\\"       \'He let Wormtongue go, and he limped off through the arch with us close   behind, until he came inside  the ring and could see all the floods that lay  between him and Orthanc. Then he turned to us.       \'\\"Let me go away!\\" he whined. \\"Let  me go away! My messages are useless  now.\\"       \'\\"They are indeed,\\" said Treebeard. \\"But you have only two  choices: to  stay  with me until  Gandalf and your master arrive; or to  cross the water.  Which will you have?\\"       \'The man shivered at the mention of his master, and put a foot into the  water; but he drew back. \\"I cannot swim,\\" he said.       \'\\"The  water is not deep,\\" said Treebeard. \\"It is dirty,  but that will  not harm you, Master Wormtongue. In you go now!\\"       \'With that the wretch  floundered off into the flood. It rose up nearly  to his neck before  he got too far away for me to see him.

The Wraiths are searching. Must take it.\'       \'Not for Him! \'       \'No, sweet  one. See, my precious: if  we  has it, then we  can escape,  even from Him, eh? Perhaps we grows very strong, stronger than Wraiths. Lord  Smjagol? Gollum  the Great?  The Gollum! Eat fish every day,  three times  a  day; fresh from the sea. Most Precious Gollum! Must have it. We wants it, we  wants it, we wants it!  \'       \'But there\'s two of them. They\'ll wake too quick and kill  us,\'  whined  Smjagol in a last effort. `Not now. Not yet.\'       \'We  wants  it! But\'  -- and here there  was a  long  pause, as if a new  thought had wakened.  `Not yet,  eh? Perhaps not. She might help. She might,  yes.\'       `No, no! Not that way! \' wailed Smjagol.       `Yes! We wants it! We wants it! \'       Each time that  the second thought spoke, Gollum\'s  long hand crept out  slowly, pawing towards Frodo, and then was drawn back with a jerk as  Smjagol  spoke  again. Finally  both  arms,  with long fingers  flexed and twitching,   ####-clawed towards his neck.       Sam had lain  still, fascinated by this debate, but watching every move  that Gollum made  from under  his half-closed eye-lids.  To  his simple mind  ordinary  hunger, the desire to eat hobbits, had seemed the chief  danger in  Gollum. He realized  now that it was not so: Gollum was feeling the terrible  call  of the Ring. The Dark Lord was He, of course; but Sam wondered who  She  was. One of  the nasty friends the little wretch had made in his wanderings,  he supposed.  Then he  forgot the  point, for things had  plainly  gone  far  enough, and were getting dangerous. A great heaviness  was in all his limbs,   but he roused  himself with an effort and sat up. Something warned him to be  careful  and  not to reveal that he had overheard  the debate. He let  out a   loud sigh and gave a huge yawn.       `What\'s the time? \' he said sleepily.       Gollum sent  out a  long  hiss  through his  teeth. He stood  up  for a   moment, tense and menacing; and then he collapsed, falling forward on to all  fours and  crawling  up the bank  of the pit. \'Nice hobbits! Nice Sam! \'  he  said. \'Sleepy heads,  yes, sleepy  heads! Leave good  Smjagol to watch!  But  it\'s evening. Dusk is creeping. Time to go.\'       `High time!  \' thought Sam. \'And time we parted,  too.\' Yet it  crossed  his mind to wonder if indeed Gollum was not now as dangerous turned loose as  kept with them. \'Curse him! I wish he was choked!\' he muttered.  He stumbled  down the bank and roused his master.       Strangely enough, Frodo felt  refreshed. He had been dreaming. The dark   shadow  had  passed,  and  a  fair  vision  had visited him in  this land of  disease. Nothing remained  of it in his  memory, yet  because of it he  felt  glad and lighter of heart. His burden was less heavy on him. Gollum welcomed  him  with  dog-like delight. He  chuckled and  chattered,  cracking his long  fingers, and pawing at Frodo\'s knees. Frodo smiled at him.       \'Come! \' he said. `You  have guided us well and faithfully. This is the  last stage. Bring us to the Gate, and then I will not ask you to go further.  Bring us to  the Gate,  and you  may  go where you wish  --  only not to our  enemies.\'       \'To  the Gate, eh?\' Gollum squeaked, seeming surprised  and frightened.  \'To the Gate, master  says! Yes, he says so.  And  good Smjagol does what he  asks, O yes. But when we gets closer, we\'ll  see perhaps we\'ll  see then. It  won\'t look nice at all. O no! O no!\'   ####-     \'Go on with you! \' said Sam. `Let\'s get it over! \'       In the falling dusk they  scrambled out of the pit and slowly  threaded  their way through the dead land. They had not gone far before they felt once  more the fear that had fallen on them  when  the winged shape swept over the  marshes.  They  halted, cowering  on the evil -smelling ground; but  they saw  nothing  in the gloomy evening sky above, and soon the  menace  passed, high  overhead, going maybe  on some swift errand  from Barad-dyr.  After  a while  Gollum got up and crept forward again, muttering and shaking.       About an hour after midnight the fear fell on them a third time, but it  now seemed more remote, as if it were passing far above the clouds,  rushing  with terrible  speed  into  the  West.  Gollum,  however,  was helpless with  terror, and was convinced that they were  being hunted, that  their approach  was known.       `Three times! \' he  whimpered.  \'Three times is  a threat. They feel us  here, they feel the Precious. The Precious is their master. We cannot go any   further this way, no."\n}', '{\n  "id": "bca717ffc4ab914aef0a77676db21bc9ce1336d8",\n  "text": "  Harry was halfway along the passage to the bar, which was now very dark, when he heard another pair of angry voices coming from the parlor. A second later, he recognized them as Mr. and Mrs.  Weasleys\'. He hesitated, not wanting them to know he\'d heard them arguing, when the sound of his own name made him stop, then move closer to the parlor door.  \\"--makes no sense not to tell him,\\" Mr. Weasley was saying heatedly. \\"Harry\'s got a right to know. I\'ve tried to tell Fudge, but he insists on treating Harry like a child. He\'s thirteen years old and --\\"  \\"Arthur, the truth would terrify him!\\" said Mrs. Weasley shrilly. \\"Do you really want to send Harry back to school with that hanging over him? For heaven\'s sake, he\'s happy not knowing!\\"  \\"I don\'t want to make him miserable, I want to put him on his guard!\\" retorted Mr. Weasley. \\"You know what Harry and Ron are like, wandering off by themselves -- they\'ve ended up in the Forbidden Forest twice! But Harry mustn\'t do that this year! When I think what could have happened to him that night he ran away from home! If the Knight Bus hadn\'t picked him up, I\'m prepared to bet he would have been dead before the Ministry found him.\\"  \\"But he\'s not dead, he\'s fine, so what\'s the point  \\"Molly, they say Sirius Black\'s mad, and maybe he is, but he was clever enough to escape from Azkaban, and that\'s supposed to be impossible. It\'s been three weeks, and no one\'s seen hide nor hair of him, and I don\'t care what Fudge keeps telling the Daily Prophet, we\'re no nearer catching Black than inventing self-spelling wands. The only thing we know for sure is what Black\'s after  \\"But Harry will be perfectly safe at Hogwarts.\\"  \\"We thought Azkaban was perfectly safe. If Black can break out of Azkaban, he can break into Hogwarts.\\"  \\"But no one\'s really sure that Black\'s after Harry  There was a thud on wood, and Harry was sure Mr. Weasley had banged his fist on the table.  \\"Molly, how many times do I have to tell you? They didn\'t report it in the press because Fudge wanted it kept quiet, but Fudge went out to Azkaban the night Black escaped. The guards told Fudge that Blacks been talking in his sleep for a while now. Always the same words: \'He\'s at Hogwarts... he\'s at Hogwarts.\' Black is deranged, Molly, and he wants Harry dead. If you ask me, he thinks murdering Harry will bring You-Know-Who back to pow er. Black lost everything the night Harry stopped You- Know-Who, and he\'s had twelve years alone in Azkaban to brood on that....\\"  There was a silence. Harry leaned still closer to the door, desperate to hear more.  \\"Well, Arthur, you must do what you think is right. But you\'re forgetting Albus Dumbledore. I don\'t think anything could hurt Harry at Hogwarts while Dumbledore\'s headmaster. I suppose he knows about all this?\\"  \\"Of course he knows. We had to ask him if he minds the Azkaban guards stationing themselves around the entrances to the school grounds. He wasn\'t happy about it, but he agreed.\\"  \\"Not happy? Why shouldn\'t he be happy, if they\'re there to catch Black?\\"  \\"Dumbledore isn\'t fond of the Azkaban guards,\\" said Mr. Weasley heavily. \\"Nor am 1, if it comes to that... but when you\'re dealing with a wizard like Black, you sometimes have to join forces with those you\'d rather avoid.\\"  \\"If they save Harry then I will never say another word against them, said Mr. Weasley wearily. \\"It\'s late, Molly, we\'d better go up....\\"  Harry heard chairs move. As quietly as he could, he hurried down the passage to the bar and out of sight. The parlor door opened, and a few seconds later footsteps told him that Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were climbing the stairs.  The bottle of rat tonic was lying under the table they had sat at earlier. Harry waited until he heard Mr. and Mrs. Weasley\'s bedroom door close, then headed back upstairs with the bottle.  Fred and George were crouching in the shadows on the landing, heaving with laughter as they listened to Percy dismantling his and Ron\'s room in search of his badge.  \\"We\'ve got it,\\" Fred whispered to Harry. \\"We\'ve been improving it.\\"  The badge now read Bighead Boy.  Harry forced a laugh, went to give Ron the rat tonic, then shut himself in his room and lay down on his bed.  So Sirius Black was after him. This explained everything. Fudge had been lenient with him because he was so relieved to find him alive. He\'d made Harry promise to stay in Diagon Alley where there were plenty of wizards to keep an eye on him. And he was sending two Ministry cars to take them all to the station tomorrow, so that the Weasleys could look after Harry until he was on the train.  Harry lay listening to the muffled shouting next door and wondered why he didn\'t feel more scared. Sirius Black had murdered thirteen people with one curse; Mr. and Mrs, Weasley obviously thought Harry would be panic-stricken if he knew the truth. But Harry happened to agree wholeheartedly with Mrs. Weasley that the safest place on earth was wherever Albus Dumbledore happened to be. Didn\'t people always say that Dumbledore was the only person Lord Voldemort had ever been afraid of? Surely Black, as Voldemort\'s right-hand man, would be just as frightened of him?  And then there were these Azkaban guards everyone kept talking about."\n}']
